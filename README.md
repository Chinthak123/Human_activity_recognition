# Human_activity_recognition
Human Activity Recognition using Random Forest Classifier
📖 About the Project

Human Activity Recognition is an important application of machine learning where the goal is to identify the activity performed by a person using sensor data. In this project, a Random Forest Classifier is used to classify different human activities based on extracted features.

🚀 Objective

To analyze sensor-based activity data

To build a machine learning model that can accurately recognize human activities

To evaluate the effectiveness of the Random Forest algorithm for classification

🧠 Model Used

Random Forest Classifier

Ensemble learning method

Combines multiple decision trees

Provides better accuracy and reduces overfitting

🔍 Workflow

Import and explore the dataset

Preprocess and clean the data

Split data into training and testing sets

Train the Random Forest model

Evaluate model performance

📊 Performance Metrics

The model is evaluated using:

Accuracy score

Confusion matrix

Precision, Recall, and F1-score

These metrics help in understanding how well the model predicts different activities.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas & NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn

▶️ Execution Steps
